  * Fixed bug. If only one hour wasn't checked '*' was still being used.
  * Fixed bug. Removed autoWrap from KTVariable, as text is wrapped
    in the line edit box anyway. Changed to use QTextEdit instead of the 
    deprecated QMultiLineEdit.
  * Fixed bug. Strip  out newlines from variable comments, because we
    only read one line of comment from crontab for each entry.
  * Fixed bug. System Crontab uses correct icon.
  * Using standard icons for everything now.
  * Added Set/Clear All buttons.
  * Added New, Modify and Delete buttons on toolbar. (Bug 54399 and
    part of bug 55684. Note about 55684: Use Ctrl-X as shortcut to delete
    item.)
  * Enabled New action when variables and tasks are selected, instead of
    only when the containing label is selected.
