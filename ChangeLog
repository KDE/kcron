  * Fixed bug. If only one hour wasn't checked '*' was still being used.

    in the line edit box anyway. Changed to use QTextEdit instead of the 
    deprecated QMultiLineEdit.
  * Fixed bug. Strip  out newlines from variable comments, because we
    only read one line of comment from crontab for each entry.
