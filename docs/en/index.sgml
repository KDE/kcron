and documented by
<htmlurl url="mailto:klemm@abacus.at" name="David Klemm">.

<sect>Installation
<p>

<sect1>How to obtain KCron
<p>
With <htmlurl url="http://www.kde.org" name="KDE"> 2.x,
KCron is distributed as part of the <tt>kdeadmin</tt> package.
<p>
The most recent stable source code release can be found on the 
<htmlurl url="http://24.8.19.113/kcron.html" name="KCron homepage">.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KCron, you need the following libraries:
<p>
- <htmlurl url="http://www.troll.no/qt/" name="Qt"> 1.44 or higher.
<p>
- <htmlurl url="http://www.kde.org" name="KDE"> 1.1.1 or higher.
KCron requires several libraries in the <tt>kdelibs</tt> package.
<p>
- Cron, such as vixie-cron.  KCron uses the <tt>crontab</tt> command to
modify user's scheduled tasks.
<p>
- POSIX-compliant Unix, such as provided by glibc.  KCron uses some standard
Unix system calls for localization of dates and times.

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>
In order to compile and install KCron on your system, first edit
<tt>Makefile.am</tt> making any necessary modifications for KDE 1.x vs.
KDE 2.x.
<tt>Makefile.am</tt> describes and provides examples of any modifications you
might need to make.

Second, type the following in the base directory of the KCron distribution:
<tscreen>
<verb> 
% ./configure 
% make 
% make install 
</verb>
</tscreen>

Please inform the <htmlurl url="mailto:gary@meyer.net" name="author">
of any modifications you had to make to get KCron to compile on your platform.
Please include operating system, compiler, Qt, and KDE version information
in your message.

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>
<sect1>Start Up
<p>
When KCron starts you will see a summarized view of scheduled tasks and
associated environment variables.  If you are running as the <tt>root</tt>

and contracted.
<p>

<p>
- <bf>Description</bf>: Natural language description of schedule
<p>
If a task has been disabled, no program file and parameters will appear and
the description will be "Disabled."
<p>
<bf>Environment Variables</bf>
